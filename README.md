# DataMiningProjects
There are some tasks relating to data mining and machine learning in this repository.
In the 1st task some clustering problems has been considered, namely point cloud clustering, color depth reducing and image segmentation.
In the 2nd task classification and regression problems has been considered including the use of dimension reduction methods.
The 3rd task is devoted to introduction into data analysis with usage of modern technologies: Apache Spark (PySpark has been used in this task) and Rapids.
The first part of the task (with PySpark) has been performed in Jupyter Notebook (LR3\LR3_Notebook.ipynb), the second part - in Google Colab (LR3\LaboratoryWork3.ipynb).
The course work is devoted to data analysis and application of machine learning algorithms. Data was taken from the site of U.S. Department of Energy (link: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml).
